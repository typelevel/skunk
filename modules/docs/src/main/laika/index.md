# Skunk

## Overview

- Skunk is a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) library for [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org).
- Skunk is powered by [cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/), [cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/), [scodec](http://scodec.org), and [fs2](https://fs2.io).
- Skunk is purely functional, non-blocking, and provides a tagless-final API.
- Skunk gives very good error messages.
- Skunk embraces the [Scala Code of Conduct](http://scala-lang.org/conduct.html).
- **Skunk is pre-release software!** Code and documentation are under active development!

Skunk is published for Scala 2.12, 2.13, and 3 on JVM, Node.js, and Native. It can be included in your project thus:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.tpolecat" %% "skunk-core" % "@VERSION@"
```
